        <dd>I am from Anand, Gujarat which is known as the "milk city of India."I have been passionate about art since I was kid as it runs in my family. Over the years i have learned different forms of art and would want to continue to do the same. I like to use my artistic talents to develop technical skills and an ability to solve problems creatively.</dd>
